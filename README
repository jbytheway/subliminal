Subliminal
==========

Subliminal is an automatic subtitle extraction system.  It compares a raw video
with one into which subtitles have been encoded and tries to extract those
subtitles to facilitate soft-subbing.

For building instructions see INSTALL.

Subliminal contains:

- boost
  Slightly tweaked version of the Boost.GIL numeric extension.
  (Note: you still need the rest of Boost; this extension is not distributed
  with it).

- ffmsxx
  A thin C++ wrapper round ffmpegsource.

- subliminal
  The program itself.

- score
  A very simple text-scoring program useful in postprocessing subliminal's
  output.

- test
  Some test data.

Note that subliminal only extracts images which it believes to be the
subtitles.  If you need text subtitles you will need an OCR program too.  I
recommend tesseract <http://code.google.com/p/tesseract-ocr/>.

As yet there is no user documentation, but you can read subliminal's --help
message and experiment with the test data.  In particular, test/Makefile
demonstrates one way to postprocess subliminal's output.
