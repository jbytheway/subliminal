Subliminal Tests
================

The test data is generated on the fly with mencoder (so you'll need mencoder to
run these tests).

You can run most of the tests with

$ make test

WARNING: Running the tests will use several hundred MB of disk space.

However, this merely extracts and OCRs subs from the test videos.  The output
is not reliable enough to verify automatically.  When the tests are complete
you can run

$ make compare

This will diff each output against the corresponding reference output.  If they
look mostly similar (just a few letters substituted by similar ones) then it's
probably doing the right thing.  If you see lots of garbage then something has
gone wrong.

The original video from which the test data is generated (root_video.avi) is a
speedrun of StarCraft Protoss level 7 (Homeland) in 1:11 by Philip 'ballofsnow'
Cornell from 2005-09-16.  See http://speeddemosarchive.com/Starcraft.html.

The character-frequencies used for scoring was produced by running

locate README | grep usr/share | xargs file | grep --text ASCII | \
  cut -d : -f 1 | xargs cat | sed 's/./&\n/g' | sort | uniq -c | \
  grep ' [ -~]$' | sed -r 's/ *([0-9]*) (.)/\2 \1'

Each test is defined by a .params file which specifies the options to use when
transcoding it.
