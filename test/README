Subliminal Tests
================

The test data is generated on the fly with mencoder (so you'll need mencoder to
run these tests).

The original video from which the test data is generated (root_video.avi) is a
speedrun of StarCraft Protoss level 7 (Homeland) in 1:11 by Philip 'ballofsnow'
Cornell from 2005-09-16.  See http://speeddemosarchive.com/Starcraft.html.

Each test is defined by a .params file which specifies the options to use when
transcoding it.
